    "## KMeans and KModes clustering algorithm\n",
    "### 18/07/2020\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are basically three types of machine learning, namely, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. In supervised Learning, there is some sort of label that we are trying to predict when supplied with a set of predictors. This is possible after a  model has learnt from historic datasets with the same data structure. Reinforcement learning is used in making of robots and A-vehicles. They tend to use the \"dog training\" method of training a machine, where the machine is rewarded for doing the right thing and otherwise if it does wrong. Along the line, the error from the machine is reduced over time. In unsupervised machine learning, our main focus for today, there is no label that we want to predict. There is only a set of features that we want to understand better the relationship between the different attributes. The most common types of unsupervised learning are clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will be considering clustering today and specifically the KMeans and KModes clustering algorithms which are both combined for Kprototypes algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "> Clustering is an unsupervised ML that aims to group the different observation(rows) of a dataset into a defined group called clusters. These clsusters are defined based on the attributes of the dataset and each cluster is made to be differently defined as well as possible. An example of real life clustering playing out is social class(stratification) which we can cluster into high class, middle class and low class. In marketing, clustering can be useful for market segmentation for more customer centric advertisemnt target. [Image Reference](http://sherrytowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kmeans_3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "> KMeans algorithm is used for clustering when all the values of interest for clustering are continous values and not discrete. In Kmeans, the number of clusters to be formed is set before clustering begins as a hyperparameter. At the first stage of iteration of the model, it first chooses random points as the centres of the points within the dataset (Note: We are working with > 1 number of features but it can help our imagination to think 1D for now). These centres are referred to as **centriods**. After randomly choosing the centroids, each observation are then assigned around each cluster. The closer a data point is to a cluster centroid, the more tendency it has to be assigned to such a cluster. After the first iteration, we now have data points clustering around each centroids and assigned to each cluster. [Image Reference (The centroids are marked in black)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/aVWMc.png). \n",
    "\n",
    "> The second iteration begins with reassigning the centroids. This time, the cluster centroids are calculated (and not chosen randomly), the centroid is calculated as the mean of the points present in the cluster. Subsequently, the data points adjust themselves around the newly formed centroids to create new clusters that reflect the newly calculated centroids. As a result of this some datapoints would fall into another cluster that was different from the one that they were in before.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This iteration continues until the centroids become stable and no longer change.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The error metrics for choosing the best number of clusters in Kmeans are the inertia score and silhouette score. The inertia score is an absolute metric which is defined as the sum of squared difference within each cluster (It is used to make elbow plots). The silhouette score is relative and goes from -1 to +1 (-1 is worst and +1 is best). [Silhouette score explained](https://vitalflux.com/kmeans-silhouette-score-explained-with-python-example/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### KModes\n",
    "\n",
    "> KModes is useful for clustering when all your features are categorical variables with finite amount of values and in which it makes no sense to compare the mean of such feature. Take for instance, the colour of a bag. While there are algorithms to encode the labels of each colour as numbers, it makes not sense at all to compare the resulting mean value for any mathematical calculation, talk less of clustering. Thus KMeans is irrelevant when dealing with categorical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to properly describe KModes, we will need to generate a table below that will help with imagination. In the Table below, the index goes from 0 to 10 (11 data points). The index be referenced as data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Before iteration, the number of clusters is set. In this case let us set Number of clusters(k) = 3. The first iteration starts by choosing random data points as the centroids according to the number of clusters (k = 3 in this case). Let us choose three(k = 3) random points as data points 0, 1 and 2 i.e. (1, A), (2, B)and (3, C) as our three centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to assign the data points around the chosen clusters, distance is used in KMeans. However in KModes, we use dissimilarity measures. In simple terms, we calcluate if the data point of a feature point is similar to another point, in this case, the centroid. Let us unpack this with an example. Let us take centroid with datapoint 0 i.e. (1, A) as our only centroid for now. The next thing to do is to calculate the dissimilarity measure of all the datapoints with our centroid. So we begin with data point 0. In data point 0, feature X is 1 and in our centroid, the feature X is also 1, this means that both the centroid and data point are similar at feature X, thus we record zero for no dissimilarity. The same is true for feature Y of both the data point 0 and the centroid. The dissimilarity measure can then be given as (0, 0) which adds up to be zero. Thus the dissmilarity measure is 0. For data point 1, comparing it with our centroid, the dissimilarity measure is given as(1, 1) which sums up to 2 because both feature X and feature Y of the data point is different from that of the centroid. For data point 3 i.e. (3, A), the dissimilarity meassure compared to our centroid is (1, 0) which sums up to 1. This is done for every data point and for every centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thus each data point is assigned to the centroid which has the lowest dissimilarity measure compared to the given data point. \n",
    "\n",
    "    See the second table. The second table is the same table with first table but it records only the first few rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> So for data point 0, it is placed in the cluster 0 with centroid_0 as its centre (It has the the lowest dissimilarity measure in centroid_0), data point 1 is placed in cluster 1 with centroid_1 as its center, data point 2 is placed in cluster 2 with centroid_2 as its centre, data point 3 is placed in EITHER cluster 0 or 2 (By randomness), data point 4 is placed in cluster 2 with centroid_2 as its centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "> After this process of clustering on random points, the mode in each cluster is then taken. The mode for each cluster is the mode of each feature seperately which now form the new centroid. For instance if datapoint 0 - 4 were assigned to cluster 1. The mode for feature X is 3 and the mode for feature Y is A and C, which we pick A by randomness. Thus the new centroid of cluster 1 becomes (3, A) and the same is done for cluster 2 and cluster 3. The data points thus adjust to fit around or rearrange around their new centres based on dissimilarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This iteration process continues until the mode is stable and does not change.\n",
    "\n",
